        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This clear broth seasoned with soy sauce seems very simplistic, but it belies the intense umami flavor within the soup. We use chicken and 4 types of dried seafood to create an incredibly savory broth that is seasoned with a soy sauce tare that gives the broth a bit of sweetness and wonderful complexity. The best thing about this recipe is that we use a pressure cooker that not only helps extract all the flavor very quickly but also creates a beautifully clear broth.

                <strong>Step 1:</strong>
                <p>
                    Place chicken, scallops anchovies, shrimp, bonito flakes, half the ginger, and kombu in an electric pressure cooker. Add water; close and lock the lid.

            <li>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong>
                <p>
                    Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Strain broth through a colander or fine-mesh seive. Skim the fatty oil off the top of the broth.

                    Combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, green onions, bonito flakes, sugar, garlic, and kombu in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors blend, about 10 minutes. Strain tare sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.
